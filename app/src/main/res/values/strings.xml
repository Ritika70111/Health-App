According to research, close to 90 percent of significant illnesses are related to high-stress levels. So it becomes necessary that you de-stress and take up things that make you happy. But do you want to know the best way to handle your stress levels? Start by spotting these early signs of stress.

You’re just not able to focus
When you’ve to deal with a truckload of work while balancing your other commitments, life can get overwhelming. It is exactly at this point, your body starts secreting cortisol, and as per research, prolonged exposure to cortisol might lead to shrinking of the hippocampus, your brain’s memory center. All of this will culminate in you feeling distracted a lot.

You Fall Sick Quite Often
 Ever wondered why as weeks and days go by you seem to be catching cold, or coughing a lot, or even feeling a little feverish. Well, it’s not just the changing weather around you, it could well be the stress you’re going through. When you’re stressed, your body secretes a stress hormone called cortisol, though they’re helpful in the short-term when they’re withdrawn from your system as days pass by, your body becomes more susceptible to sickness.</string>
    Your memory is a little hazy
    Have you misplaced your keys quite a few times this week? Or have you found yourself forgetting a word while speaking? Poor memory recall has often been linked to excessive stress. In fact, research shows that stress can reduce spatial memory, that part of your brain, which helps you locate objects and other seemingly ordinary day-to-day things.
